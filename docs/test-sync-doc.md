# Test Sync Document

This is a temporary document to verify GitKnowledgeSource change detection.

## Purpose

This file tests that the controller:
1. Detects new commits in the repository
2. Syncs only changed files (incremental sync)
3. Ingests the document into the knowledge base

This file will be removed after testing.
