                  DebounceWindowSeconds is the time window to collect CRD events before sending to MCP
                  When a CRD event is received, the controller waits for this duration to collect
                  more events, then sends them all in a single batched request.
                  This reduces HTTP requests when operators are installed (many CRDs at once).
