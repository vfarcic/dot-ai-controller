## Fix GitKnowledgeSource Continuous Sync Loop

GitKnowledgeSource no longer syncs continuously in a tight loop. Previously, every status update triggered a new reconcile, causing the controller to re-clone and re-sync the repository non-stop instead of waiting for the configured schedule.

The controller now uses `GenerationChangedPredicate` to only reconcile on spec changes. Scheduled syncs via cron or interval expressions continue to work as configured.
