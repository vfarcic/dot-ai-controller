## GitKnowledgeSource Sync Phase Visibility

GitKnowledgeSource now shows a `Phase` column in `kubectl get gks` output, providing immediate feedback on sync status. Previously, the status only updated after the entire sync completed, leaving users unable to tell whether a configuration fix was picked up.

The Phase field transitions through `Syncing`, `Synced`, and `Error` states. When reconciliation starts, the phase is set to `Syncing` and persisted immediately — before cloning or ingesting documents — so users see progress right away. On completion it moves to `Synced`, or `Error` if any issues occurred (authentication failures, clone errors, partial sync failures).
