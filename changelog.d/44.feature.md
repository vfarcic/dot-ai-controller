## GitKnowledgeSource CRD

Automatically sync documentation from Git repositories to the MCP knowledge base. Previously, users had to manually ingest documents or build custom tooling to keep their knowledge base current with repository changes.

The new `GitKnowledgeSource` CRD provides a declarative way to specify Git repositories and file patterns for ingestion. The controller clones repositories, matches files using glob patterns (e.g., `docs/**/*.md`), and syncs them to MCP. Change detection ensures only modified files are processed on subsequent syncs, making it efficient for large repositories. Scheduled sync supports both cron expressions (`0 3 * * *`) and intervals (`@every 24h`), with a default of daily syncs staggered across resources to avoid thundering herd issues.

Key capabilities include private repository support via token authentication, file size filtering with `maxFileSizeBytes` to skip large generated files, and detailed status reporting showing document counts, skipped files, and sync errors. The `deletionPolicy` field controls whether documents are removed from MCP when the CR is deleted (default: Delete) or retained for migration scenarios.

Configure a knowledge source by creating a CR with the repository URL, branch, file patterns, and MCP server endpoint. The controller handles cloning, change detection, and cleanup automatically.
