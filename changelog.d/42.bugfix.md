**Fix Infinite Reconciliation Loop When Status Exceeds etcd Size Limit**

Resolves an issue where the ResourceSyncConfig controller would enter an infinite reconciliation loop when the status object grew too large, exceeding etcd's 3MB object size limit. This caused massive CPU usage and log flooding as the controller repeatedly attempted status updates that could never succeed.

The controller now caps the `SyncErrors` counter at 100,000 to prevent unbounded growth and truncates error messages to 1KB maximum. When status updates fail due to "entity too large" errors, the controller enters a 5-minute backoff period instead of retrying immediately. All status fields are sanitized before each update to ensure they fit within etcd limits.

If you encounter this issue before upgrading, the workaround is to delete and recreate the affected ResourceSyncConfig to reset its status.
