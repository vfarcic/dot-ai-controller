**Stack Installation Notes in Feature Guides**

The Resource Sync Guide and Capability Scan Guide now include a "Stack Installation" section that clarifies these features are automatically configured when using the [DevOps AI Toolkit Stack](https://devopstoolkit.ai/docs/stack). Users who installed via the Stack can verify their configuration exists and skip the manual Quick Start steps. This helps users understand they only need to follow the manual setup if customizing the configuration or installing the controller individually.
