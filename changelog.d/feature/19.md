**Graceful Shutdown Handling**

The controller now handles SIGTERM signals gracefully during rolling updates, node drains, and pod evictions. Previously, in-flight MCP remediation calls and reconciliation operations were terminated abruptly, potentially leaving resources in inconsistent states or causing duplicate event processing.

When shutdown is initiated, the readiness probe immediately returns unhealthy, signaling Kubernetes to stop routing new traffic. In-flight operations continue processing with a 20-minute grace period, allowing long-running MCP remediation calls to complete naturally. Context cancellation propagates through HTTP clients and retry loops, ensuring clean termination when the timeout expires.

The Helm chart is preconfigured with `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 1260` (21 minutes) to accommodate the shutdown timeout plus buffer. No user configuration is required—graceful shutdown works automatically with default settings.
